Engineering Made Easy!
This website is created by students from The Oxford College of Engineering with the main goal of helping fellow engineering students in their studies. Unlike other platforms, our website combines all the essential study materials a student needs in one place. From model question papers to detailed notes and a CGPA/SGPA calculator, we've got it all covered. Our aim is to ensure that students don't have to search multiple websites for different resources — they can find everything they need right here, in one convenient location.

Key Features:
• Model Papers from all 8 semesters
• Study Notes across various subjects
• CGPA/SGPA Calculator to easily calculate academic scores
• And much more to come!
